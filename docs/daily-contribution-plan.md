## Daily Routine Template

### Morning (30-45 min)
1. Check GitHub notifications and issues
2. Review overnight CI/benchmark results  
3. Plan day's specific tasks
4. Quick sync with any collaborators

### Evening (45-90 min)
1. Code development/testing session
2. Run benchmarks on changes
3. Document findings and issues
4. Submit PRs or file issues
5. Update progress tracking

## Weekly Milestones

**Week 1-2:** Baseline established, bottlenecks identified
**Week 3-4:** First major kernel optimizations deployed  
**Week 5-6:** Significant performance improvements measured
**Week 7-8:** Integration with upstream frameworks complete
**Week 9-10:** Multi-GPU and advanced features working
**Week 11-12:** Production-ready optimizations documented

## Contribution Targets

### Repositories to Focus On:
1. **ROCm/pytorch** - Core PyTorch integration improvements
2. **ROCm/flash-attention** - Attention mechanism optimizations
3. **ROCm/composable_kernel** - Custom kernel development
4. **ROCm/MIOpen** - Convolution optimizations
5. **huggingface/diffusers** - SD pipeline integration

### Success Metrics:
- **Performance:** 80%+ of NVIDIA RTX 4090 speed on comparable AMD hardware
- **Community:** 50+ GitHub stars on optimization repos
- **Adoption:** Integration into major SD interfaces (ComfyUI, A1111)
- **Recognition:** AMD acknowledgment of contributions

## Cost Management Strategy

### To Stay Within Claude Billing:
1. **Batch Questions:** Prepare comprehensive queries vs frequent small ones
2. **Async Work:** Do research/coding independently, then validate with Claude
3. **Focus Sessions:** 2-3 intensive Claude sessions per week vs daily small ones
4. **Documentation:** Build knowledge base to reduce repeated questions
5. **Community:** Use Discord/GitHub for simple questions, Claude for complex architecture

### Weekly Claude Usage Plan:
- **Monday:** Architecture review and weekly planning (30-45 min)
- **Wednesday:** Code review and debugging session (45-60 min)  
- **Friday:** Performance analysis and next week planning (30-45 min)
- **Emergency:** Quick debugging sessions as needed (15 min max)

This plan balances ambitious goals with sustainable daily progress while respecting your Claude billing constraints.
