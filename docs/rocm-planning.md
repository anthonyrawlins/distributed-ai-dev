I’ll outline a comprehensive development strategy to improve ROCm’s performance for Stable Diffusion inference, with the goal of matching or exceeding NVIDIA CUDA's performance. This will include architectural focus areas, key bottlenecks, community engagement, benchmarking, and upstream contribution paths.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a structured development roadmap tailored to your objective.


# ROCm Performance Roadmap for Stable Diffusion Inference

This roadmap outlines a multi-year plan to elevate AMD’s ROCm stack for Stable Diffusion (SD) inference, targeting NVIDIA-level performance. We will leverage AMD’s open platforms (HIP, MIOpen, Composable Kernel, Triton, etc.) and contribute upstream to all relevant projects. Key focus areas include architecture analysis, bottleneck elimination, compiler/kernel optimizations, memory strategies, PyTorch integration, model-level accelerations, benchmarking, and open collaboration. Throughout, we cite ROCm documentation and benchmarks to ground our strategy.

## Architectural Analysis: ROCm (AMD) vs CUDA (NVIDIA)

We begin with a detailed comparison of AMD GPU architectures (RDNA3 consumer, CDNA3 datacenter) versus NVIDIA’s architectures (Ampere/Hopper). AMD’s latest Instinct MI300X (CDNA3) GPUs use an *Accelerator Complex Die* (XCD) design with 38+ disabled CUs, 32KB L1 per CU and 4 MB shared L2 per XCD. MI300X systems stack up to 8 XCDs plus HBM3, yielding an aggregated 5.3 TB/s memory bandwidth. Notably, CDNA3 introduces **Matrix Cores** supporting FP64/FP32/FP16/BF16/INT8/FP8 with large speedups (e.g. \~3× for FP16/BF16, 6.8× for INT8, 16× for FP8 over FP32). In contrast, NVIDIA’s GPUs use CUDA cores and Tensor Cores (e.g. Hopper’s WMMA) with similarly high FP16/FP8 throughput. AMD’s RDNA3 (e.g. Radeon 7900 XTX) targets gaming and has 96 CUs, 24 GB GDDR6 at 960 GB/s with a 96 MB “Infinity Cache” L3. NVIDIA’s flagship datacenter cards (e.g. H100) offer comparable or higher HBM bandwidth and NVLink interconnects.

Action items:

* **Benchmark hardware**: Quantify current SD inference speed per device (MI100/200/300, 7900XTX, etc.) against NVIDIA baselines (e.g. RTX 4090).
* **Document microarchitecture**: Create detailed docs on wavefront vs warp size, cache hierarchy, kernel concurrency (e.g. ACEs/CUs) for the SD team.
* **Optimize for AMD architecture**: Leverage Infinity Cache (RDNA3) and HBM/Infinity Fabric fully, adjusting memory layouts and bus widths in kernels as needed.

## Bottlenecks in ROCm SD Inference

Initial profiling shows key bottlenecks in ROCm-based SD inference often lie in **attention** and **VAE decoding** steps, as well as suboptimal memory utilization. AMD users report that Naive attention (“split attention”) is used by default, causing slowdowns. We will target state-of-the-art attention like FlashAttention or xFormers-style tiling to reduce memory traffic. VAE decoding (upsampling convolutions) is also comparatively slow on AMD, suggesting work to fuse or replace its kernels (e.g. using MIOpen conv or custom HIP kernels). Memory throughput issues appear when working with large latent tensors; AMD’s architecture demands careful memory coalescing. For example, Flash Attention 2’s tiling greatly improves locality by dividing Q/K/V loops into SRAM tiles. We will apply similar tiling in all kernels (attention, VAE, ResNet blocks) to exploit the 5+ TB/s HBM bandwidth on MI300X.

* **Attention** – Replace PyTorch’s default attention with optimized versions. Use AMD’s CK FlashAttention2 on MI200/MI300 or Triton FlashAttention on RDNA3. Work with the OpenAI Triton fork or ROCm/xFormers to enable fast query-key-value tiling (e.g. up to 256-head dims) on all AMD GPUs.
* **VAE Decoder** – Profile the VAE upsampling convolutions and activation. If MIOpen lacks an optimal fwd/bwd fused conv+upsample, use CK to fuse conv, bias, and activation into a single kernel. Consider low-precision (FP16/INT8) or tensor-core variants on CDNA3.
* **Memory & TensorOps** – Inspect global memory patterns (prefetching, caching). Adjust tensor strides/tiling to avoid thrashing caches. Leverage large L3 Infinity Cache on RDNA3 for frequently reused data. If needed, implement checkerboard or tile-based generation to fit working sets.

Action items:

* Instrument ROCm SD pipeline (using rocprof/rocm-smi) to pinpoint kernel hotspots (especially Softmax, MatMul, Conv) in attention and VAE steps.
* Integrate FlashAttention or xFormers (see below) and measure latency improvements; report results upstream.
* Implement fallback detect: if head sizes or batch dims trigger slow paths, mitigate via autotuning.

## Compiler and Kernel-Level Optimizations

ROCm offers HIP for CUDA-portability and libraries like MIOpen (convolutions, RNNs) and rocBLAS. We will deepen use of these and contribute missing ops. In particular:

* **HIP Toolchain**: Audit PyTorch-generated HIP kernels for inefficiencies (e.g. no shared memory usage). Where necessary, write custom HIP kernels or amend HIPify rules. AMD’s HIPIFY/CUDA converter should be extended for new CUDA tensor intrinsics.
* **MIOpen Enhancements**: Review MIOpen versions for fused operations (e.g. fused conv+ReLU, conv+bias, Winograd). Propose new kernels or tuning for SD-specific shapes. Engage with AMD’s MIOpen team (via GitHub/MIOpen issues) to upstream such improvements.
* **Composable Kernel (CK)**: Use CK to create **fused kernels** for critical paths. For example, fuse an entire transformer block (GEMM→ReLU→GEMM) or an Attention-MHA block (MatMul-Softmax-MatMul) into one CK instance. CK allows C++ templating for various data precisions and layouts, maximizing utilization of Matrix Cores on MI300X.
* **Triton Kernels**: Exploit OpenAI Triton (via PyTorch Inductor) to generate custom kernels on AMD. Since TorchInductor on ROCm uses Triton as a backend, we will create Triton kernels for SD ops (e.g. fused batched matmul + bias). Contribute Triton enhancements back (e.g. enabling Triton’s mma instructions on AMD GPUs).
* **Autotuning (TunableOp)**: Enable PyTorch’s TunableOp feature to pick the best GEMM/Conv kernels at runtime. By generating *gemm\_tunable\_op\_configs* (offline or at startup), the fastest rocBLAS or hipBLASLt kernels will automatically back `torch.nn.functional.linear` and similar ops.

Action items:

* Develop and upstream a Flash-Attention2 implementation using CK and Triton (see model optimizations).
* Write CK-based kernels for fused layers (e.g. Conv→Add→Act); test on MI300X (CDNA3) and MI100/MI200 (CDNA1/2).
* Collaborate on HIP coarsening/loop unrolling improvements in the ROCm compiler (HIP-CLANG) for SD workloads.
* Contribute new PyTorch/CUDA kernels (via HIP) if certain CUDA ops (e.g. torch.special.ops) are missing on ROCm.

## Memory Management & Tiling Strategies

Stable Diffusion’s large U-Nets and VAEs demand careful memory use. We will implement advanced tiling, buffering, and memory-planning techniques:

* **FlashAttention Tiling**: As noted, FlashAttention2’s tiling improves SRAM reuse. We will embed similar tiling for Q/K/V loops on ROCm, using either CK or Triton.
* **Activation/Feature Tiling**: For high-resolution inference (e.g. 1024×1024), split the latent image into tiles or streams to fit GPU memory, then stitch outputs. Develop tiled upscaling or patch-based diffusion if necessary.
* **Gradient Checkpointing (if needed)**: Although inference does not need backward, we can repurpose checkpointing techniques (compute-interleave) to trade compute for memory, allowing larger batch sizes or resolutions.
* **Memory Pooling and Layouts**: Ensure PyTorch/ROCm uses a memory pool to reduce fragmentation. If PyTorch’s allocator is suboptimal on ROCm, propose improvements or alternative allocators (e.g. ROCm Malloc GPU). Align tensor strides for coalesced access on AMD’s 64-thread wavefronts.
* **Multi-GPU Tiling**: For multi-GPU SD (e.g. pipelined Diffusers), split the model’s U-Net layers across GPUs or data-shard. Leverage AMD Infinity Fabric for high-bandwidth tensor exchanges.

Action items:

* Implement FlashAttention (see above) to reduce off-chip memory bandwidth.
* Prototype tiled SD inference (splitting latents/patches) and measure memory savings.
* Monitor and tune PyTorch’s ROCm memory allocator; possibly use environment variables (e.g. `HCC_ENABLE_LARGE_BAR`) per AMD docs.

## PyTorch ROCm Backend Integration & Optimization

PyTorch on ROCm is upstreamed but lags CUDA in some optimizations. We will work at the PyTorch level:

* **Upstream Contributions**: Submit PRs to the official PyTorch repo (ROCm branch) to optimize or add kernels discovered above. For example, if a fused FlashAttention kernel is written in HIP, we will integrate it via the ROCm/pytorch repo.
* **HIPIFY Workflow**: Since PyTorch auto-converts CUDA to HIP (HIPIFY), we will refine HIPIFY scripts to handle any SD-specific CUDA (e.g. special index operations). Work with AMD’s HIP team to support new CUDA intrinsics if needed.
* **TorchInductor Compilation**: Encourage SD models to use `torch.compile(mode="max-autotune")`. Since ROCm supports TorchInductor via Triton, ensure the compiled kernels are correct and optimal. For dynamic decoding loops, fix the “static key/value cache” trick by patching PyTorch to allow `max_cache_length`. Document this in guides.
* **TunableOp / Autotuner**: As above, enable `PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_ENABLED=1` in SD pipelines so that best GEMM/Conv kernels (from rocBLAS/hipBLASLt) are chosen at runtime. Contribute performance data (GEMM tables) for common SD dimensions upstream.
* **ROCm PyTorch Builds**: Ensure compatibility with the latest PyTorch releases. Contribute to ROCm’s build scripts and CI so that PyTorch 2.x features (inductor, torch.compile) remain functional on ROCm.

Action items:

* Work through the **ROCm/pytorch** GitHub (fork AMD’s repo or contribute via staging branches) to merge ROCm-specific optimizations and keep in sync with upstream PyTorch.
* Enable and test TorchInductor/Triton on SD pipelines; file bugs with AMD/RoCM if any CUDA-specific patterns fail HIPIFY.
* Add support for `torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel` toggles on ROCm to ensure flash-attention is used when available.

## Model-Level Optimizations (xFormers, VAE, Schedulers)

We will integrate high-level SD-specific libraries and tricks:

* **xFormers**: AMD provides an **ROC/xformers** port. Use the ROCm xFormers (CK-backed) for efficient multi-head attention in SD’s transformer blocks. As AMD notes, xFormers attention (tiling QKV) performs similarly to FlashAttention. We will deploy CK xFormers in HuggingFace Diffusers (set `attn_implementation="xformers"`).
* **FlashAttention**: Likewise, ensure HuggingFace SD pipelines can use `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` with our AMD FlashAttention builds. This may require modifying diffusers or StableBaselines to accept the new backend.
* **VAE and Encoder/Decoder**: Investigate quantized VAE decoders. If acceptable for accuracy, implement INT8 or FP8 VAE (using CDNA3’s INT8/FP8 support). Also consider model pruning or distillation to smaller VAEs.
* **Schedulers and Loop Fusions**: While schedulers (DDIM, PLMS, etc.) are CPU-bound, we can fuse their update loops on GPU or use faster arithmetic. Offload any simple pre/post-processing to GPU kernels.
* **Upscalers and Extras**: If deploying features like SuperResolution or ControlNet, optimize their networks similarly (fused convs, attention). Off-the-shelf libraries (e.g. AMD’s SRGAN) may need adapting.

Action items:

* Merge and install **ROCm xFormers** and **ROCm FlashAttention** libraries. Test on SD models to validate correctness and speed.
* Benchmark VAE decode in FP16/INT8 on MI300; if quality loss is minor, upstream lower-precision support.
* Contribute a condensed “lite” VAE model with fused kernels to AMD’s model-zoo for SD.

## Benchmarking Framework and KPIs

We will develop a robust benchmarking suite for SD inference:

* **Metrics**: Throughput (images/sec), latency (time per prompt), memory footprint, and power (if applicable). Also compare accuracy or visual quality (e.g. FID/CLIP) if any quantization is used.
* **Standard Benchmarks**: Align with MLPerf Inference v4.0’s SDXL reference (Stable Diffusion XL), which specifies dataset, prompts, and accuracy metrics. This ensures our results are comparable to industry.
* **Tools and Framework**: Base on HuggingFace Diffusers or vLLM to run inference. Automate tests on target hardware (e.g. MI300X, MI200, Radeon 7900XTX) and NVIDIA GPUs. Use Docker images (ROCm PyTorch 2.x) for consistency.
* **Profiling and Tracking**: Integrate ROCm profiler (rocprof, rocm-smi) to gather time breakdown. Set up nightly CI performance tests.
* **KPIs**: Define targets like “match or exceed NVIDIA Ada’s throughput on SD v1.5/v2.1” and track progress. Use percentage-of-baseline metrics (e.g. 100% of RTX4090 speed).

Action items:

* Build an **SD inference benchmark suite** using Diffusers (512×512 and 768×768) as Tom’s Hardware did. Include CPU-side loading/inference overhead measurement.
* Automate MLPerf SDXL pipeline: use their model weights and scripts (from mlcommons) to evaluate on ROCm hardware and record metrics.
* Publish benchmark results (images/sec and error bars) on our internal dashboards and in public RFCs.

## Coordination & Upstream Collaboration

We will tightly coordinate with AMD’s ROCm team and the open-source communities:

* **ROCm Repositories**: Regularly contribute to key AMD repos: `ROCm/pytorch`, `ROCm/MIOpen`, `ROCm/flash-attention`, `ROCm/xformers`, and `ROCm/composable_kernel`. Follow each project’s contribution guidelines (e.g. code style, tests).
* **AMD ROCm Team**: Engage via the official AMD ROCm GitHub discussions and issue trackers. Request design reviews from AMD engineers before major PRs (e.g. new MIOpen kernels). Leverage AMD developer support channels for large changes.
* **Upstream Frameworks**: When improving PyTorch or Triton, ensure PRs go into the official repositories (or AMD’s ROCm forks if necessary), with references to ROCm compatibility. For example, submit new SD-specific kernels to PyTorch and CC AMD maintainers.
* **Community Standards**: Follow AMD’s “roadmap and RFC” practices. AMD publishes ROCm roadmaps and sometimes invites community input (e.g. via ROCm blog or GitHub discussions). We will propose an **SD/AI performance roadmap** (open-access) aligned with AMD’s vision.
* **Joint Testing**: Partner with AMD for early testing of major ROCm releases (e.g. beta ROCm with new MIOpen). Report bugs and performance issues promptly, helping AMD improve their releases.

Action items:

* Set up regular sync meetings (biweekly) with AMD’s ROCm engineers focusing on ML performance.
* Maintain a **matrix of ROCm GitHub issues/PRs** targeting our fixes (e.g. flags for new kernels, bug patches).
* Engage with the wider ML community (HuggingFace, mlcommons) by contributing our optimizations back (e.g. pull requests to Diffusers to support AMD kernels).

## Community Engagement & Transparency

We will maintain an open development model:

* **RFCs and Public Roadmaps**: Publish our plans and interim designs (e.g. FlashAttention integration plan) as **Requests for Comments** on GitHub or a project wiki. Encourage feedback from AMD developers and the ML community.
* **Blogs and Talks**: Co-author blog posts (with AMD if possible) on ROCm optimizations for SD, highlighting performance gains (similar to AMD’s ML stack updates). Present findings at conferences (e.g. ROCmCon, MLPerf Workshops).
* **Issue Transparency**: Use public issue trackers. If we discover bottlenecks in ROCm (e.g. missing op), we will log them as issues (not private silos). When resolved, share the improvements.
* **Contributor Onboarding**: Document how others can reproduce our benchmarks and build our optimized ROCm tools. Host a GitHub repo (e.g. `our_org/rocm-sd-optimizations`) with CI for pull requests.

Action items:

* Publish a **public roadmap doc** summarizing goals for each quarter.
* Open a GitHub repository “SD-ROCm-Performance” with reference benchmarks and setup instructions.
* Draft a monthly update (blog or newsletter) on progress, linking to PRs/commits.

## Long-Term Maintainability & Documentation

To ensure longevity:

* **CI and Testing**: Add continuous integration to run SD inference tests on each PR (e.g. using AMD’s CI docker images). Automate correctness checks (outputs match reference) and performance regression tests.
* **Code Quality**: Enforce coding standards (e.g. HIP style, Python linting). Review all new kernels for readability and comment. Include fallback and edge-case handling.
* **Documentation**: Write comprehensive docs/tutorials: how to build ROCm with our kernels, how to run optimized SD, how to reproduce benchmarks. Use AMD’s documentation style (MarkDown on GitHub, or contributing to ROCm docs).
* **Knowledge Transfer**: Train team members in ROCm internals. Maintain a **wiki** of hardware quirks and optimization tricks discovered (e.g. which `__shfl` or shared memory sizes work best).
* **Future Proofing**: Plan for new architectures. E.g., as AMD releases RDNA4/CDNA4 or new FP8 support, revisit kernels. Ensure code is modular so new data types (e.g. new INT4/FP6) can be added.

Action items:

* Create a “Performance Guide” wiki summarizing our best practices (citing AMD docs where applicable, e.g. CK guides).
* Maintain a versioned release schedule: e.g. “v1.0: basic optimizations done (date), v2.0: advanced fusion (date)”, etc., aligned with major ROCm versions.
* Keep documentation in sync with code; mandate docs updates for every significant change.

By following this plan, our team will systematically close the performance gap. We will leverage AMD’s rich documentation and tools, work upstream in the open, and establish clear metrics to demonstrate success. This ensures that ROCm becomes a **first-class platform** for Stable Diffusion and other AI workloads, on par with (or ahead of) CUDA.

**Sources:** AMD’s ROCm documentation and architecture whitepapers; ROCm component guides (CK, FlashAttention, xFormers); ROCm/PyTorch compatibility notes; and industry benchmarks. All cited materials are from AMD’s official docs or public benchmark analyses.
